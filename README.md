# My PVC Pipes App Web Services

PVC Pipes is an application that is going to be used by an organization to make the process of buying PVC Pipes easier and user friendly. We are going to start selling PVC Pipes only to plumbing companies here in Phoenix, Arizona. We want to start small and as we get more clients and more revenue we can start selling to other locations. 

PVC Pipes are used in new construction as well as remodeling old buildings. Since this is a startup, we think that offering the buyers a user-friendly application and one that only focuses on selling PVC Pipes will give us a competitive advantage.

Since we are starting small this application is going to be a client server application. This application will be shared to single users at the beginning and once we have a safe and reliable application, we would like to make the application web enabled.
